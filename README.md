# Windows Admin Center Ideas & Feedback

This github repo will only serve as a way for you to give your feedback and ideas to the Windows Admin Center team. Due to the migration away from UserVoice, we will be using this temporary solution in the interim to collect your invaluable feedback. This is a public repo so anyone can view its contents, so please keep this in mind as you provide feedback, as to not include any personal information. 

## Instructions

To file a bug or feature request, please follow the steps to create an issue as shown on this [Creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) page. We have already created 2 issue templates for you to use:
- üêû Bug Report
- üìÉ Feature Request

### Voting

We will use the reactions as a way to vote. Only the üëç emoji will count as an upvote. 

### Previous Forums for Feedback

We know you have spent time writing these issues and feature requests. They are not lost, we have kept the UserVoice posts with 15 or more upvotes in our database. Any issue that you filed on the Microsoft Forms has been filed as bugs and feature requests have been sent to our backlogs. 

Thank you so much for your time and dedication! üòä
